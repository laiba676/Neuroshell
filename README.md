NeuroShell â€” AI Virtual Voice Assistant with Streamlit & Vosk
NeuroShell is a lightweight, offline-capable AI voice assistant that uses the Vosk speech recognition model to convert speech to text, processes commands or questions, and responds in real time through a Streamlit web interface. It also exposes an optional REST API for developers who want to integrate voice recognition into their own apps.
Run Streamlit app
bash
streamlit run app.py
